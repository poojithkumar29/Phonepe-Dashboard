This project is an **End-to-End Data Analysis Solution** using **Microsoft Power BI** to create a multi-page dashboard based on real-world application data, mirroring the operations of the popular digital payments giant, PhonePe.

The primary goal is to **enhance data analysis skills** by creating a fully functional, interactive dashboard that provides actionable insights into:
* Total transaction volume and monetary value.
* Performance of key financial services (Money Transfer, Insurance, Loans).
* Crucial monitoring of **failed payments** to identify systemic issues.

### 🌟 Dashboard Structure (5 Pages)

The Power BI file (`phonepe (1).pbix`) contains a comprehensive 5-page report designed for seamless navigation via custom **buttons**:

1.  **Home Page (Overview):** Summarizes high-level KPIs, total amounts, and quick success/failure rates.
2.  **Money Transfers:** Detailed analysis of core payment transactions.
3.  **Recharge & Bills:** Tracking utility and bill payment service performance.
4.  **Insurance Payments:** Deep dive into policy sales and premium collection.
5.  **Loans:** Analysis of various loan products (Auto, Personal, etc.).

### 🔍 Key Metrics & Analysis

Each page in the dashboard is built around specific visualizations and metrics:

| Service Page | Core Metrics | Key Visualizations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **All Services** | **Total Transaction Amount**, Total Successful Payments, **Failed Payments Count**. | **Date Range Slicer** (for interactivity), Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). |
| **Service Specific** | Breakdown of transaction types (e.g., *Term Life vs. Car Insurance*, *Auto vs. Personal Loans*). | **Amount vs. Month** (Trend Analysis), **Service vs. Amount** (Contribution Bar Chart). |
| **Failure Analysis** | Reasons for failed payments (e.g., Server Error, Insufficient Balance, Wrong Details). | **Payment Status Pie Chart** (Successful vs. Failed), Dedicated Failure Reason chart. |
